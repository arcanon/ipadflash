Overview
========

GUI is the window creation, borders, events, etc.
Renderer is what we use to draw graphics onto the drawing area

GUI
===

Frontends are modeled by the gnash::Gui class.

They take care of initializing the Backend module for use in rendering.

For the frontend we have GTK, SDL, KDE(QT), FLTK2, Aqua, Framebuffer.

Functions to implement:

init(int argc, char **argv[]): 	
This funtion is run first to initialize GUI-specific parameters/variables.

createWindow(const char* title, int width, int height): 
Here we create a window-widget with calling parameters.

setCursor(gnash_cursor_type newcursor):
This function is called when the cursor-type is changed.

run(): 
This is the main()-call for the GUI.

Renderer
========

Backends modeled by the gnash::render_handler class.

They are the actual renderers, drawing to a memory buffer.

For the renderers we have Antigrain (AGG), OpenGL or Cairo.
