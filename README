This page hopes to provide flash for the ipad or iphone running iOS and within Safari. 
The great thing here is that gnash is currently under development. This requires 
your device to be jail broken (not detailed here, search on the Internet). 

See gnash_ipad.sh as the starting point. But there is currently a lot of information
missing (for example SDL is compiled very differently then the current configure/makefiles)!
So if you get stuck drop me a line.
